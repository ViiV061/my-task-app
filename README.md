# Project Description

**TaskFlow** is an intuitive and flexible task management application designed to help users efficiently organize and track both personal and work-related tasks. It allows users to create multiple workspaces (boards), each containing multiple task lists (cards). Users can customize these lists based on projects, priorities, or workflows, and add, edit, and move tasks within them. TaskFlow's design focuses on user experience, offering features such as drag-and-drop functionality, task duplication, and quick editing, making task management simple and effective.
